\section*{Abstract}

The net radiative forcing (RF) from methane is a consequence of both direct emissions of methane and chemical loss from emissions of short-lived (SL) precursor gases NOx, CO, and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs). Dramatic changes in the spatial distribution of these emissions and their uncertain trajectory have important implications for both climate forcing and air quality mitigation.  We attribute here net methane RF  to spatially-resolved emissions using an adjoint methodology and compute the impact of these emissions on future radiative forcing for the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 6.0.  Normalized methane lifetime sensitivity  to annual anthropogenic emissions of NOx, CO, and NMHC emissions is -0.145, 0.047, and 0.027 respectively. The net RF from the opposing effects of NOx and CO+NMHC emissions varies considerably depending upon location and magnitude.  Under RCP 6.0 in 2050,  we find the combined top 10\% of locations with positive net RF is responsible for 50\% of the global positive RF and the top 10\% of negative RF  cause 60\% of the global negative RF. We examine the radiative forcing response in China in particular, considering how deviations from the RCP emissions trajectories will impact the response given the new knowledge of the spatially-resolved sensitivities.
