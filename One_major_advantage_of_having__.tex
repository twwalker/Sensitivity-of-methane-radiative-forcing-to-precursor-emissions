One major advantage of having spatially explicit attribution of the radiative forcing to precursor emissions is that it allows for quick comparison among regions of interest. For example, Table~\ref{tab:megacity} shows the sensitivity of methane lifetime to precursor emissions averaged over $3\times 3$ grid cell areas centered on the megacities recently studied in fully coupled chemistry-climate simulations~\citep{ref:dang2015}. These values are not directly comparable to the radiative forcing due to a one year pulse of all emissions from each of these megacities; however, they provide some insights into the spatial variability of the effects of precursor emissions on climate forcing.

All the megacities except Lagos demonstrate sensitivity higher in magnitude than the global mean values for all precursor species. There is also marked variability in the relative sensitivity of NOx to CO among these locations; in particular, the two cities in China have sensitivities to CO larger in magnitude than to NOx, which is not the case for any of the other cities. By comparison,~\citet{ref:dang2015} found the indirect methane radiative forcing due to CO larger than that from NOx only for New Delhi, although unlike the values reported here, their results are not normalized by the magnitude of present day emissions. The relative contribution to forcing from changes in NOx and CO has implications, for example, on changing the fuel mix used in power generation from coal to natural gas, or on the implementation of industry-specific controls (e.g. cement production, steel sintering).
