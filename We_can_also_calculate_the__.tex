We can also calculate the impact of changes in emissions for particular model grid boxes.

\begin{table} 
  \label{tab:megacity}
  \begin{tabular}{ c c c c c }
        City & RCP8.5 NOx emissions change & RCP8.5 CH4 emissions change & change in RF from NOx & change in RF from CH4 \\ 
        Beijing & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 
        Mumbai & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 
        Sao Paulo & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 
    \end{tabular}
