The distribution of the global forcing is weighted toward a small number of locations. At 2050, the top 10\% of locations that have a positive radiative forcing contribution total 50\% of the total positive forcing. The top 10\% of locations with negative radiative forcing contributions total XXX\% of the total negative forcing.

What is the overall implied forcing at 2050? 2100? Due to each species individually?
