The distribution of the cumulative global equivalent emissions is weighted toward a small number of locations. At 2050, the top 10\% of locations that have a positive radiative forcing contribution total 50\% of the total positive forcing. The top 10\% of locations with negative radiative forcing contributions total 60\% of the total negative forcing. Overall, in RCP 6.0 at 2050, NOx changes contribute 62 Tg/yr of equivalent emissions, methane contributes 55 Tg/yr, CO contributes 13 Tg/yr, and NMHC contribute 2 Tg/yr. Note that these are all positive. Globally, the emissions of methane and NMHC increased, but NOx and CO emissions decreased. The reason a global decrease in CO still contributes a positive radiative forcing is that the places where emissions increased had larger sensitivities, and contributed enough in equivalent emissions to offset the decreased CO emissions elsewhere.
