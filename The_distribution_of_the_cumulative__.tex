The distribution of the cumulative global equivalent emissions is weighted toward a small number of locations. At 2050, the top 10\% of locations that have a positive equivalent emissions account for 50\% of the total positive equivalent emissions. The top 10\% of locations with negative equivalent emissions account for 60\% of the total negative equivalent emissions. Overall, in RCP 6.0 at 2050, NOx changes contribute 62 Tg/yr of equivalent emissions, methane contributes 55 Tg/yr, CO contributes 13 Tg/yr, and NMHC contribute 2 Tg/yr. Globally, the net global emissions of methane and NMHC increased whereas NOx and CO emissions decreased. In spite of the global decrease, CO emissions still contribute to a positive CH4 radiative forcing because regions with positive CO emissions also  had large RF sensitivities sufficient to offset the decreased CO emissions elsewhere.
