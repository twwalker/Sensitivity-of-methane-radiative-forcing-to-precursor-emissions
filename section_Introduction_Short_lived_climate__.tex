\section{Introduction}

Short-lived climate forcers alter the Earth's radiative balance on timescales of a decade or less. Pollutants such as $\mathrm{NO_x}$ and $\mathrm{CO}$ affect the Earth's radiative balance not only through ozone formation, but also alter the local hydroxyl radical concentration, which affects the lifetimes of longer-lived greenhouse gases. Methane loss in particular is dominated by hydroxyl-driven loss in the troposphere~\citep{ref:kirschke2013}.

Previous studies have calculated the sensitivity of methane lifetime to precursor emissions~\citep{ref:holmes2013}, but lack the ability to calculate these at better than global or regional resolution. Full chemistry-climate model studies have been performed for individual megacities~\citep{ref:dang2015}, but the computational cost of perturbing every location individually is prohibitive. Performing this calculation with the adjoint of a chemical transport model provides unprecedented resolution.
