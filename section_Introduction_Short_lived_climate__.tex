\section{Introduction}

Short-lived climate forcers alter the Earth's radiative balance on timescales of a decade or less.

Previous studies have calculated the sensitivity of methane lifetime to precursor emissions~\citep{ref:holmes2013}, but lack the ability to calculate these at better than global or regional resolution. Performing this calculation with the adjoint of a chemical transport model provides unprecedented resolution.
