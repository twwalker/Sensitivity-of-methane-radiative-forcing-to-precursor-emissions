\section{Precursor emissions' contributions to methane radiative forcing in RCP 6.0}

The spatially explicit sensitivity values (shown in the Methods section) aggregate into a normalized global annual mean sensitivity of the methane lifetime (i.e. $d \mathrm{ln}(\tau)/d\mathrm{ln}(\mathrm{E})$) to land-based anthropogenic NOx, CO, and NMHC emissions of -0.145, 0.047, and 0.027 respectively, comparable to previously reported global values~\citep{ref:fry2012,ref:holmes2013}. However, the method employed here enables the study of regional differences in how methane radiative forcing responds to changes in precursor emissions, and what that implies for the climate impacts of future air quality control and climate change mitigation strategies. As an example, we calculate the methane radiative forcing due to emissions changes projected under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 6.0~\citep{ref:vanvuuren2011}.
