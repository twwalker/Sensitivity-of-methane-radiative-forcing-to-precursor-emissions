Sensitivity of methane radiative forcing in $\mathrm{mW/m^2}$ in July to emissions of (a) surface anthropogenic NOx, (b) surface anthropogenic CO, (c) surface anthropogenic NMHC, and (d) biomass burning NOx emissions. The sensitivity is semi-normalized by the emissions ($\mathrm{E \dot \partial F/\partial E}$). \label{fig:rfsens}
