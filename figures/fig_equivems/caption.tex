Radiative forcing of methane under RCP 6.0. The maps show the change in methane radiative forcing (in $\mathrm{mW/m}^2$) due to changes in emissions of (a) NOx, (b) CO+NMHC, (c) CH4, and (d) all emissions combined, projected under RCP 6.0 from 2000 to 2050. The right column shows (b) relative changes in global total emissions of each species over the century, as well as the equivalent methane emissions (in Tg/yr) needed to cause the forcings on the left. NOx, CO, and NMHC have been combined into a single term labelled chemical sink.\label{fig:eqems}
