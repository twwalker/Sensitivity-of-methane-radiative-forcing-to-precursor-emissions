Unnormalized version of Figure~\ref{fig:rfsens}. Units are mW/m2 per Tg/yr of emissions. This explains why methane RF exhibits greater sensitivity to relative changes in CO emission from China - the sensitivity is almost uniform in terms of mass unit of emissions. However if you are looking at a fractional change, that represents a larger number of CO molecules in China.l
