\section{Methods}

The GEOS-Chem adjoint model~\cite{ref:henze2007} (v35) is based on the forward GEOS-Chem model v9-02 (\href{http://www.geos-chem.org}{}). It permits efficient calculation of the gradient of a metric of model outputs, such as concentrations, to all model inputs simultaneously, including emissions and reaction rates~\cite{ref:walker2015}.

\begin{equation}
J=\sum_{i \in D} \mathrm{k}_i \mathrm{[OH]}_i \mathrm{[CH_4]}_i,
\end{equation}
where the subscript $i$ denotes each model gridbox within the tropospheric domain $D$, and $\mathrm{k}_i$ is the temperature-dependent bimolecular rate constant for hydroxyl-driven methane loss~\citep{ref:sander2011}.

The adjoint-derived sensitivities are combined with emissions drawn from representative concentration pathways (RCP,~\citet{ref:vanvuuren2009}).
