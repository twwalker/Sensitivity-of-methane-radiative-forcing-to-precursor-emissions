\section{Methods}

The GEOS-Chem adjoint model\cite{ref:henze2007} (v35) is based on the forward GEOS-Chem model v9-02 (\href{http://www.geos-chem.org}{}). It permits efficient calculation of the gradient of a metric of model outputs, such as concentrations, to all model inputs simultaneously, including emissions and reaction rates\cite{ref:walker2015}.
