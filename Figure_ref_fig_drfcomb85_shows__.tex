Figure~\ref{fig:drfcomb85} shows the change in radiative forcing under emissions changes predicted by RCP 8.5 in the year 2050. In this scenario, methane emissions increase globally, while NOx continues to decrease in North America and Europe, but increases in the first half of the century in developing India and China. This increase in NOx produces a negative radiative forcing response in methane in those regions, which competes with the positive forcing from methane emissions increases.

The effects of changes in NOx, CO, and CH4 emissions on the global methane radiative forcing are shown separately, and represent a combination of the emissions changes, given by the RCP, and the local sensitivity of the methane radiative forcing to these changes, given by the adjoint analysis.
