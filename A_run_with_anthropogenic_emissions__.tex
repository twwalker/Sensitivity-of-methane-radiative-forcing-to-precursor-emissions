A run with anthropogenic emissions of NOx, CO, and NMHC's perturbed upward by 20\% was also performed for January 2006, and the resulting sensitivities are compared with those from the unperturbed simulation in Figure~\ref{fig:diffstate}. The sensitivities appear to be robust over such a range of emissions, and not be dependent on the underlying emissions.
