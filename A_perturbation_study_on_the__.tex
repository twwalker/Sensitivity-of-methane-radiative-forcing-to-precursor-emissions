%A perturbation study on the RCP emissions in China demonstrates the effect of decreasing the activity levels in the energy, industry, and transportation sectors is decreased by 30\% after 2030 (all species are reduced by this amount). This sectoral decrease represents a decrease of 19-21\% in total NOx, 19-23\% in total CO, 6-7\% in total NMHC, and 3-5\% in total methane at these locations over the century. These changes to the emissions trajectory have almost entirely offsetting forcings in the Pearl River Delta and Sichuan Basin, while the difference in NOx and CO sensitivity in Shanghai and Beijing cause this perturbed emission pathway to have lower total methane radiative forcing than RCP 6.0, by 41\% and 65\% respectively.
