\section*{Abstract}

Methane's atmospheric lifetime depends on the concentration of tropospheric hydroxyl radicals, which respond to changes in short-lived gas emissions, such as \BPChem{NO_x} and CO. We develop a method to calculate the sensitivity of the methane radiative forcing to changes in emissions of these precursor gases at grid scale using an adjoint model.
