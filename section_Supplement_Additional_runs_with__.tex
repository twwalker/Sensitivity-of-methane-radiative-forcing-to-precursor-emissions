\section{Supplement}

Additional runs with the GEOS-Chem adjoint model were performed to test the robustness of the result to the choice of a one-month window for the calculation of sensitivities, and to the methodology's assumption of linearity over the range of emissions being tested. A run with a 45-day time window was performed for January 2006 and the resulting sensitivities are compared to the 31-day result in Figure~\ref{}.
