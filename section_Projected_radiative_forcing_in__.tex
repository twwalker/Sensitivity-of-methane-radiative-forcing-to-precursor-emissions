\section{Projected radiative forcing in China}

China is projected to more than double both CO and NOx emissions between 2000 and 2050, and 8 of the top 20 equivalent emissions magnitudes at 2050 are located in China. We examine this in more detail, selecting four locations with disparate emissions signatures and differing sensitivity to emissions. Shanghai and Beijing are megacities, and the Pearl River Delta is heavily urbanized, while the Sichuan Basin is an oil and gas producing region in central China. The sensitivity of methane loss to NOx emissions generally decreases with latitude across the four sites (PRD being the largest value), but the two megacities in eastern China have particularly high sensitivity to CO and NMHCs, a feature unique to China. Figure~\ref{fig:intrfchina} shows the century-integrated forcing for the four locations, split by species.
